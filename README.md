CS-control's purpose is to increase the flexibility of their servers. It does this by allowing the admin to create a list of commands, and then attaching those to a macro key. This makes it so you can switch gamemodes/maps/teams very quickly and with ease.
  
It was swiftly made at a LAN for a tournament, so bugs should be expected. If everything fails, then the settings file inside ```/assets/``` can easily be used to change the macros/ip addresses/passwords if anything goes wrong.
